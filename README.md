It simulates a driven, coupled 4‑qubit lattice as a global density matrix 
, evolves it through a coherent unitary step + local dissipative (Kraus) noise step, computes a large set of diagnostics (entanglement, “memory currents”, thermodynamic length/Bures geometry, OSEE, etc.), then renders an animated dashboard + exports plot data + serves an HTML report for a Boolean Linear Seperator.
